## :rocket: 5 minutes quick start
First you need to check if you have all the requirements installed on your machine:

| Dependencies | Version |
|--------------|---------|
| PHP          | \>= 7.4 | 
| Composer     | latest  | 
| Laravel      | 8.x     | 

:bulb: Install all packages of the `package.json` on your project. This will download everything you need.


```
composer install
```
<br>

## :computer: Running the server

:bulb: After all the dependencies have been installed, you just need to run the server with the following command:

```
php artisan serve
```
